# Touching Files
create two new files `/tmp/pwn` and `/tmp/college`, and then run `/challenge/run` to verify and to get the flag .
## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wcz3a9lVpRHpT1ZgFfZA71XytdK.QXwMDO0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1. `ls /challenge`, to list the contents of the dir
2. Found the flag file named as `22424-renamed-run-25978`
3. execution of the found file
5. Flag captured

```bash
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ touch /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ touch /tmp/college
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:

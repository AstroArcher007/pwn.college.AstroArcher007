# More Catting Practice!
Read the file using the absolute path, but find the path first.
## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{AFOuZFJmX7H9H8EXgjHR_RQaE7V.QXwITO0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1. `ls` to list the elements in the dir
2. `cd` to `~/t`, as no hint available
3. returns path of the file in the ERROR: `/usr/lib32/flag`
4. `cat/usr/lib32/flag` 
5. Flag captured

```bash
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ ls 
t
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cd t
You used 'cd'! In this level, I don't allow you to change the working directory 
--- you MUST chase pass 'cat' the absolute path of where I put it on the 
filesystem (which is /usr/lib32/flag).
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /usr/lib32/flag
pwn.college{AFOuZFJmX7H9H8EXgjHR_RQaE7V.QXwITO0wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

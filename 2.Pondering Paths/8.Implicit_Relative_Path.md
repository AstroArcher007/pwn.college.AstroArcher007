# Implicit relative path

The challenge was to run `/challenge/run` using relative path, with cwd as `/challenge` dir

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{ggpWbEVNuuui7ZKdPjE7Hmo0lyN.QXxUTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1. Navigated to `/challenge` dir using `cd` command
2. Tried executing run , using `run` cmd, but fails. 
3. Executed `/challenge/run` using relative path `./run`
4. Flag captured.

```bash
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:~$ cd /challenge
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ run
bash: run: command not found
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Correct!!!
./run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{ggpWbEVNuuui7ZKdPjE7Hmo0lyN.QXxUTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
To execute programs in the current directory, use `./` as prefix in the name of the executable. This is to prevent the execution of other system util, of the same name. Shell tries to execute a system util of the same name, if the executable's name is given without `./`

## References 
NONE.

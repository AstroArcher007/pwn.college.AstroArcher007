# Explicit relative paths, from /

The challenge was to run `/challenge/run` using relative path, with cwd as `/` root dir

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{08O52mdLHHz14Azom2M7yoNQotM.QXwUTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1. Navigated to `/` dir using `cd` command
2. Executed `/challenge/run` using relative path `./challenge/run`
3. Flag captured.

```bash
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ ./challenge/run
Correct!!!
./challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{08O52mdLHHz14Azom2M7yoNQotM.QXwUTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
`.` refers to the current directory
`..` refers to the parent directory, one level higher.

## References 
NONE.

# Program and Absolute Path
had to run the `run` program, stored in the root `/challenge` directory

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sS2WNRqjXii10F_PE7CTsKFVzdy.QX1QTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}`


```bash
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{sS2WNRqjXii10F_PE7CTsKFVzdy.QX1QTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

I feel it's easy just in the begining, after that, it's gonna cook me so bad.

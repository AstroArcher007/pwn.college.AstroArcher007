# Implicit relative paths, from /

The challenge was to run `/challenge/run` using relative path, with cwd as `/` root dir

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0gz5oj2mQOcuCTrIqLKPWGOv-nu.QX5QTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1. Navigated to `/` dir using `cd` command
2. Executed `/challenge/run` using relative path `challenge/run`
3. Flag captured.

```bash
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ challenge/run
Correct!!!
challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0gz5oj2mQOcuCTrIqLKPWGOv-nu.QX5QTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
Relative and absolute paths

## References 
NONE.

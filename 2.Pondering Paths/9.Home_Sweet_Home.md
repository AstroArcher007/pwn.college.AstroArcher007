# Home Sweet Home
In the challenge, `/challenge/run` write the flag to the directory given as the argument of the command. The argument direcotry has to be in the home dir, the argument must be an absolute path, and before expansion the argument must be three charaters or less.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{IKFnIxNDxaoY7yIQn8EJrt5yUs2.QXzMDO0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

- 1. Tried executing `/challenge/run` without argument, returns error.
- 2.  Added the argument `/challenge/run ~/t`
- 3. Flag captured.

```bash
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run
You must provide an argument to /challenge/run when you invoke it!
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/t
Writing the file to /home/hacker/t!
... and reading it back to you:
pwn.college{IKFnIxNDxaoY7yIQn8EJrt5yUs2.QXzMDO0wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
The usage `~` and its representation of the `/home/user` directory.

## References 
NONE.

# Position Thy Self
This challenge wanted us to change a "current working directory" to a specific directory and the from there, we had to execute the run program in `/challenge` directory, using its absolute path

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{csdoQ3Vv5siI6gbqFj0ejt-O3YW.QX2QTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1. I tried running the program from home directory as the required directory was not provide
2. Running it, gave me the actual required cwd
3. Navigated to the required cwd `/var`, using cd command
4. executed `/challenge/run` from `/var` directory
5. Flag captured

```bash
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /var directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /var
hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/var$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{csdoQ3Vv5siI6gbqFj0ejt-O3YW.QX2QTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

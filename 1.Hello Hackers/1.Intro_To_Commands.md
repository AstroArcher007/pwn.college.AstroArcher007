# Intro To Commands
had to invoke `hello` command to get the flag.
## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{c-7ZFsJ6bpCpoMKHJAD3KnxspQ4.QX3YjM1wSO0AzNzEzW}`

Just followed the instructions, lol XD


```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{c-7ZFsJ6bpCpoMKHJAD3KnxspQ4.QX3YjM1wSO0AzNzEzW}

```


## What I learned
got an intro to SSH.

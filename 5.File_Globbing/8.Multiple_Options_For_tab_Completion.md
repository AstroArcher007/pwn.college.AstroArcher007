# Multiple Options for Tab Completion

The challenge was to use tab completion to find the flag file when multiple file options were available.

-----

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{cG5nIGI-fzQqM-cTHMXT_kIYDtD.0lN0EzNxwSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I started typing the command `cat /challenge/files/pwncollege-`.
2.  After pressing the `Tab` key twice, the shell displayed a list of all files that started with that prefix because the completion was ambiguous.
3.  From the list, I identified `pwncollege-flag` as the most likely file containing the flag.
4.  I completed the filename and executed the `cat` command to read the file.
5.  The flag was successfully retrieved.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@globbing~multiple-options-for-tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/files/pwncollege-
cat: /challenge/files/pwncollege-: No such file or directory
hacker@globbing~multiple-options-for-tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/files/pwncollege-
pwncollege-family      pwncollege-flag        pwncollege-flamingo    pwncollege-flyswatter  pwncollege-hacking     
hacker@globbing~multiple-options-for-tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/files/pwncollege-flag
pwn.college{cG5nIGI-fzQqM-cTHMXT_kIYDtD.0lN0EzNxwSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

When tab completion has **multiple possible matches** for a given prefix, pressing `Tab` once may not do anything. Pressing it a **second time** will list all the available options, allowing you to see the choices and type more characters to resolve the ambiguity.

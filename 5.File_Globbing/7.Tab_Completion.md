# Tab Completion

The challenge was to use shell tab completion to find and print the flag file.

-----

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{klktNoEijeEvmmm_eM5Sv42ZV3l.0FN0EzNxwSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I started typing the command `cat /challenge/pwn`.
2.  I pressed the `Tab` key, and the shell autocompleted the path to `/challenge/pwncollege`.
3.  Executing the `cat /challenge/pwncollege` command printed the flag to the console.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/pwncollegeâ€‹ 
pwn.college{klktNoEijeEvmmm_eM5Sv42ZV3l.0FN0EzNxwSO0AzNzEzW}
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ 
```

## What I learned

The `Tab` key is a powerful feature in most shells for autocompletion. It can complete commands, file paths, and variable names, which helps to speed up workflow and prevent typographical errors.

# Tab Completion on Commands

The challenge was to find and execute a command using tab completion.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{I1KzgggrE2JCDCj8Q4syC7yIm9d.0VN0EzNxwSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I started typing a likely prefix for the challenge command, such as `pwn`.
2.  By pressing the `Tab` key, the shell automatically searched for executable files in the `$PATH` and autocompleted the command name to `pwncollege-16568`.
3.  I pressed `Enter` to run the command.
4.  The flag was then printed to the console.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-16568 
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{I1KzgggrE2JCDCj8Q4syC7yIm9d.0VN0EzNxwSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

Tab completion isn't just for file paths; it also works for **executable commands**. The shell searches all the directories listed in the `$PATH` environment variable to find commands that match the typed prefix, making it a very efficient way to find and run programs.

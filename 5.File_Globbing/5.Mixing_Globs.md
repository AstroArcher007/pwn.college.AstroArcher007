# Mixing Globs

The challenge was to combine different globbing wildcards to match the correct filename needed by the executable.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{0KTtwWhEoJmc3DfWLP_5CiUoXKY.QX1IDO0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I started by moving into the `/challenge/files` directory and listing its contents to see the possible files.
2.  I then used a combined glob pattern, `[cep]*`, as an argument for the `/challenge/run` program.
3.  This pattern successfully matched the required file(s) because it looks for any filename starting with either 'c', 'e', or 'p' (`[cep]`), followed by any sequence of characters (`*`).
4.  The flag was then displayed.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ ls
amazing    challenging  educational  great  incredible  kind      magical  optimistic  queenly  splendid   uplifting   wonderful  youthful
beautiful  delightful   fantastic    happy  jovial      laughing  nice     pwning      radiant  thrilling  victorious  xenial     zesty
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [cep]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{0KTtwWhEoJmc3DfWLP_5CiUoXKY.QX1IDO0wSO0AzNzEzW}

## What I learned

Different globbing wildcards can be **combined** to create more precise and powerful search patterns. For example, mixing `[...]` and `*` allows you to match files based on a specific set of starting characters while being flexible about the rest of the filename.

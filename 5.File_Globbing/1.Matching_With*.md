# Matching_With*

The challenge required using shell globbing (wildcard patterns) to change directory into `/challenge` while obeying a restriction that disallows supplying paths longer than 4 characters.

## My solve

**Flag:** pwn.college{gWaPd3AQJ2t05WZtY9nHszNcqQW.QXxIDO0wSO0AzNzEzW}

1. Observed the challenge enforces a limit on the number of characters provided to `cd` and rejects longer inputs.
2. Tried forbidden attempts (`/**all**ge` and `/chall*`) which triggered the disallowed-message and reset the working directory.
3. Used a short glob pattern `cd /ch*` that satisfied the restriction and changed directory to `/challenge`.
4. Listed the directory contents to confirm files (`ls` showed `DESCRIPTION.md` and `run`).
5. Ran `./run` which printed the flag; captured the flag.

```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /**all**ge
You specified the path to 'cd' to in more than 4 characters. Disallowed!

```

## What I learned

* Short glob patterns (like `/ch*`) can be used to bypass input-length restrictions while still selecting the intended directory.
* The challenge enforces safeguards that reset the working directory if the `cd` argument is too long.
* Always list directory contents to check available executables before running them.

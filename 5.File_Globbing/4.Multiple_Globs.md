# Multiple Globs

The challenge was to use globbing wildcards to match and pass the correct filename as an argument to the challenge executable.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{8yd5xOA3uxF2S5KODfHF1u6SQFK.0lM3kjNxwSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  First, I navigated to the `/challenge/files` directory.
2.  Then, I used the glob pattern `*p*` with the `/challenge/run` executable. This pattern expands to match any filename in the current directory that contains the letter 'p'.
3.  The shell passed the matched filename as an argument to the program, which accepted it as the correct input.
4.  Finally, the flag was captured.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *p*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{8yd5xOA3uxF2S5KODfHF1u6SQFK.0lM3kjNxwSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

The `*` wildcard is a powerful tool in shell globbing that **matches any sequence of characters**, including an empty sequence. By placing it on both sides of a character or string (e.g., `*p*`), you can efficiently match any file that contains that character or string anywhere in its name.

# Exclusionary Globbing

The challenge was to use exclusionary globbing to provide the correct file argument to the challenge executable, which also required being run from a specific directory.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{YKt9TSagiiGuTM9ZoH9OtcUVTr1.QX2IDO0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  My first attempt failed because the executable required the current working directory to be `/challenge/files`.
2.  I changed the directory to `/challenge/files` using the `cd` command.
3.  I then used the exclusionary glob pattern `[!pwn]*`. This pattern matches any file that does **not** start with 'p', 'w', or 'n'.
4.  The shell expanded this pattern and passed the matching filenames to `/challenge/run`, which solved the challenge.
5.  The flag was captured.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:~$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/[!pwn]*
Error: please run with a working directory of /challenge/files!
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [!pwn]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{YKt9TSagiiGuTM9ZoH9OtcUVTr1.QX2IDO0wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

To perform exclusionary or negative matching in shell globbing, you can use the `!` character (or `^` in some shells) as the first character inside the square brackets `[]`. The pattern `[!abc]` will match any single character that is **not** 'a', 'b', or 'c'.

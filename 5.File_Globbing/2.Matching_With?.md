# Matching with ?

The challenge was to use the `?` globbing wildcard to navigate to the `/challenge` directory.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{cU7674INK1Djelrk18N1RSyreDd.QXyIDO0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  Used the `cd` command with the glob pattern `/?ha??enge` to change the current directory to `/challenge`. The `?` wildcard matches any single character.
2.  Executed the `run` program in the `/challenge` directory.
3.  Flag captured.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ ls
DESCRIPTION.md  run
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ ./run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{cU7674INK1Djelrk18N1RSyreDd.QXyIDO0wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

The `?` wildcard can be used in shell globbing to match exactly one character. This is useful when parts of a filename or path are unknown or need to be generalized.

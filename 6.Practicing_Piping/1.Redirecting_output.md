# Redirecting Output

The challenge was to redirect the output of a command into a file.

-----

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{wIVx4_XTHJdpOA9i_2pBtJbF8F_.QX0YTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I used the `echo PWN` command to generate the string "PWN" on standard output.
2.  I then used the output redirection operator `>` to capture that output.
3.  The output was redirected into a new file named `COLLEGE`. This action fulfilled the challenge's condition, causing the flag to be printed.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your 
flag:
pwn.college{wIVx4_XTHJdpOA9i_2pBtJbF8F_.QX0YTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

The `>` operator in the shell is used for **output redirection**. It takes the standard output (stdout) of the command on its left and writes it to the file specified on its right. If the file doesn't exist, it's created. If it does exist, its contents are **overwritten**.

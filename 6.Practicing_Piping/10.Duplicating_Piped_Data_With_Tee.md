# Duplicating Piped Data with tee

This challenge required using the `tee` command to inspect the data in a pipeline to figure out the correct arguments for the first program.

-----

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{QzusZpC0LXsCRdLAZOFBTaplgnw.QXxITO0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  My initial attempt involved piping `/challenge/pwn` into `/challenge/college`, using `tee pwn` in the middle to save the intermediate output to a file named `pwn`.
2.  I then examined the `pwn` file using `cat`. This revealed the usage instructions for the `/challenge/pwn` command, showing that it required a secret argument: `--secret QzusZpC0`.
3.  After a few unsuccessful attempts to format the command, I built the correct pipeline.
4.  The final, successful command was `/challenge/pwn --secret QzusZpC0 | /challenge/college`. This provided the correct secret from the first program to the second, solving the challenge.

Processing...
The input to 'college' does not contain the correct secret code! This code 
should be provided by the 'pwn' command. HINT: use 'tee' to intercept the 
output of 'pwn' and figure out what the code needs to be.
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ cat pwn
Usage: /challenge/pwn --secret [SECRET_ARG]

SECRET_ARG should be "QzusZpC0"

You must pipe the output of /challenge/pwn into /challenge/college (or 'tee' 
for debugging).
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn --secret [QzusZpC0] | /challenge/college
Processing...

Correct! Passing secret value to /challenge/college...
Great job! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{QzusZpC0LXsCRdLAZOFBTaplgnw.QXxITO0wSO0AzNzEzW}

## What I learned

The **`tee`** command is an essential tool for debugging pipelines. It reads from standard input and writes to both standard output and one or more files. This acts like a "T-splitter" in a plumbing pipe, allowing you to **inspect the data flowing between commands without interrupting the pipeline**.

# Grepping Errors

The challenge required piping the standard error (stderr) stream from an executable into `grep`.

-----

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{4YlPlFGLgJTbBh4t4EiC1W135fl.QX1ATO0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I ran the `/challenge/run` program, which was designed to print the flag to its standard error stream.
2.  To capture this, I first used the special redirection **`2>&1`**. This merges the standard error (file descriptor 2) into the standard output (file descriptor 1).
3.  Then, I used the pipe operator **`|`** to send the newly combined stream (containing both original stdout and stderr) to the standard input of `grep pwn.college`.
4.  `grep` filtered the combined stream and successfully extracted the flag.

```bash
hacker@piping~grepping-errors:~$ /challenge/run 2>&1 | grep pwn.college
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stderr : grep
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /challenge/.data.txt

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /challenge/.data.txt file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stderr to another process. Checking...
[TEST] Performing checks on that process!

[INFO] The process' executable is /nix/store/8b4vn1iyn6kqiisjvlmv67d1c0p3j6wj-gnugrep-3.11/bin/grep.
[INFO] This might be different than expected because of symbolic links (for example, from /usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python3 to /usr/bin/python3.8).
[INFO] To pass the checks, the executable must be grep.

[PASS] You have passed the checks on the process on the other end of my stderr!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.

## What I learned

By default, the pipe `|` operator only redirects standard output. To process errors or other non-stdout streams, you must first merge them into stdout. The syntax **`2>&1`** is a standard shell idiom that means "redirect stderr to the same destination that stdout is currently going to." This allows you to process a command's complete output stream with tools like `grep`. 🌪️

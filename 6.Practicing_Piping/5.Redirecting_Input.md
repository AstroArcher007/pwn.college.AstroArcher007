# Redirecting Input

The challenge was to provide input to a program by redirecting the contents of a file to its standard input.

-----

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{MFTA-g1RaF45ADwmIuMDTwMTkea.QXwcTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  First, I created a file named `PWN` that contained the required input string, `COLLEGE`, using the command `echo COLLEGE > PWN`.
2.  Next, I executed the `/challenge/run` program.
3.  I used the **input redirection operator `<`** to connect the program's standard input to the `PWN` file. This made the program read the contents of the file.
4.  The program successfully read the "COLLEGE" string, and the challenge was solved.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ echo COLLEGE > PWN
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ /challenge/run < PWN
Reading from standard input...
Correct! You have redirected the PWN file into my standard input, and I read 
the value 'COLLEGE' out of it!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{MFTA-g1RaF45ADwmIuMDTwMTkea.QXwcTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

The **`<` operator** is used for **input redirection**. It takes the file on its right and feeds its contents into the **standard input (stdin)** of the command on its left. This is a powerful way to provide pre-written input to a program without having to type it in manually.

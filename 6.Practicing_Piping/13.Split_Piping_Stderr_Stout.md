# Split Piping stderr and stdout

The challenge was to take a single program's output and send its standard output to one program and its standard error to another, all within one command line.

1.  The solution required a sophisticated use of redirection combined with process substitution for both the stdout and stderr streams.
2.  The command `/challenge/hack > >( /challenge/planet ) 2> >( /challenge/the )` was used.
3.  This command can be broken into two parts:
      * `> >( /challenge/planet )`: This redirects the **standard output** (file descriptor 1, implied by the single `>`) into the standard input of the `/challenge/planet` program via process substitution.
      * `2> >( /challenge/the )`: This redirects the **standard error** (file descriptor 2) into the standard input of the `/challenge/the` program, also via process substitution.
4.  This setup successfully split the two output streams from `/challenge/hack` and routed each to a different program's input, solving the challenge.

## What I learned

This is an advanced shell technique for creating complex data pipelines. By combining **explicit file descriptor redirection** (i.e., `2>`) with **process substitution** (`>(...)`), you can simultaneously route different output streams from one command to the standard inputs of multiple other commands. This allows for powerful, parallel processing of a program's output without needing intermediate files.

hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ mkfifo /tmp/flag_fifo
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ /challenge/run >/tmp/flag_fifo
You're successfully redirecting /challenge/run to a FIFO at /tmp/flag_fifo! 
Bash will now try to open the FIFO for writing, to pass it as the stdout of 
/challenge/run. Recall that operations on FIFOs will *block* until both the 
read side and the write side is open, so /challenge/run will not actually be 
launched until you start reading from the FIFO!

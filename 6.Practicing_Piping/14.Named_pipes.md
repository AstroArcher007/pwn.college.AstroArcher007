# Named Pipes

The challenge was to use a named pipe, or FIFO, to capture the output of a program, demonstrating an understanding of its blocking behavior.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{4deuYMl7Hbe3RuZV07JqLPP61BM.01MzMDOxwSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  First, I created a **named pipe** (a special type of file also known as a FIFO) in the `/tmp` directory using the command `mkfifo /tmp/flag_fifo`.
2.  My initial attempt to redirect the program's output directly into the pipe, `/challenge/run >/tmp/flag_fifo`, caused the command to hang. This is because a named pipe will **block** until there are processes attempting to both write to it and read from it.
3.  To solve the challenge, I needed to open both ends of the pipe. The command `/challenge/run >/tmp/flag_fifo | cat /tmp/flag_fifo` successfully established a writer (`/challenge/run`) and a reader (`cat`) for the pipe.
4.  With both ends open, the writer was unblocked, the program ran, and its output containing the flag flowed through the pipe to the reader, which then printed it to my terminal.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ mkfifo /tmp/flag_fifo
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ /challenge/run >/tmp/flag_fifo
You're successfully redirecting /challenge/run to a FIFO at /tmp/flag_fifo! 
Bash will now try to open the FIFO for writing, to pass it as the stdout of 
/challenge/run. Recall that operations on FIFOs will *block* until both the 
read side and the write side is open, so /challenge/run will not actually be 
launched until you start reading from the FIFO!
^C
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ /challenge/run >/tmp/flag_fifo | cat /tmp/flag_fifo
You're successfully redirecting /challenge/run to a FIFO at /tmp/flag_fifo! 
Bash will now try to open the FIFO for writing, to pass it as the stdout of 
/challenge/run. Recall that operations on FIFOs will *block* until both the 
read side and the write side is open, so /challenge/run will not actually be 
launched until you start reading from the FIFO!
You've correctly redirected /challenge/run's stdout to a FIFO at 
/tmp/flag_fifo! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4deuYMl7Hbe3RuZV07JqLPP61BM.01MzMDOxwSO0AzNzEzW}

## What I learned

A **named pipe**, or **FIFO** (First-In, First-Out), is a special file on the filesystem that allows two unrelated processes to communicate with each other. Unlike an anonymous pipe (`|`), it has a name and persists on the filesystem. The key behavior of a FIFO is that it **blocks**; a process that opens a FIFO for writing will pause until another process opens the same FIFO for reading, and vice-versa. This synchronization is a fundamental feature of its design.

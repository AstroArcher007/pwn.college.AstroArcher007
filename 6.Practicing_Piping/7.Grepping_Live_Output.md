# Grepping Live Output

This challenge involved "piping" the output of the challenge executable directly into `grep` to filter it in real-time.

-----

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{glbUJFHH-1HfRFlZzDbCvHIyFeA.QX5EDO0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I executed the `/challenge/run` program.
2.  Instead of saving the output to a file, I used the **pipe operator `|`**.
3.  This operator took the standard output from `/challenge/run` and immediately used it as the standard input for the `grep pwn.college` command.
4.  `grep` then filtered this "live" stream of data, printing only the line that contained the flag, without the need for a temporary file.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@piping~grepping-live-output:~$ /challenge/run | grep pwn.college
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge checks for a specific process at the other end of stdout : grep
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /challenge/.data.txt

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /challenge/.data.txt file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to another process. Checking...
[TEST] Performing checks on that process!

[INFO] The process' executable is /nix/store/8b4vn1iyn6kqiisjvlmv67d1c0p3j6wj-gnugrep-3.11/bin/grep.
[INFO] This might be different than expected because of symbolic links (for example, from /usr/bin/python to /usr/bin/python3 to /usr/bin/python3.8).
[INFO] To pass the checks, the executable must be grep.

[PASS] You have passed the checks on the process on the other end of my stdout!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
pwn.college{glbUJFHH-1HfRFlZzDbCvHIyFeA.QX5EDO0wSO0AzNzEzW}

## What I learned

The **pipe operator `|`** is a fundamental feature of command-line shells. It creates a **pipeline** that connects the **standard output** of the command on the left to the **standard input** of the command on the right. This allows you to chain multiple commands together, processing data in stages without creating intermediate files. It's a cornerstone of the Unix philosophy of using small, specialized tools to build complex workflows. ⛓️

# Redirecting More Output

The challenge required redirecting the output of an executable to a file and then reading that file to find the flag.

-----

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{EbOKbBFS4wAVUBydHrNo_hVNOy6.QX1YTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I executed the `/challenge/run` program and used the `>` operator to **redirect its standard output** into a file named `myflag`.
2.  The program's output, now captured in the file, indicated that the redirection was successful.
3.  After a couple of failed attempts to read the file using an absolute path (`/myflag`), I listed the directory contents with `ls` to confirm the file was created in the current directory.
4.  I then used `cat myflag` to **read the contents of the newly created file**, which contained the flag.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-more-output:~$ /challenge/run > myflag
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : myflag
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /flag

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /flag file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called myflag. Checking...

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
hacker@piping~redirecting-more-output:~$ cat /flag
cat: /flag: Permission denied
hacker@piping~redirecting-more-output:~$ cat /myflag
cat: /myflag: No such file or directory
hacker@piping~redirecting-more-output:~$ ls
 COLLEGE   Desktop   myflag  'of how this environment variable is handled.'   t
hacker@piping~redirecting-more-output:~$ cat myflag

[FLAG] Here is your flag:
[FLAG] pwn.college{EbOKbBFS4wAVUBydHrNo_hVNOy6.QX1YTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

This challenge was a good reminder that when you redirect output to a filename without a path (like `> myflag`), the file is **created in the current working directory**. It also reinforces the difference between **absolute paths** (starting with `/`) and **relative paths** (not starting with `/`).

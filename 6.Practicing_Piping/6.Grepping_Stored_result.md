# Grepping Stored Results

The challenge involved saving the output of a program to a file and then using the `grep` command to search for the flag within that file.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{QwrgqITIIBQEPEAjs7m5ocv-u5d.QX4EDO0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  After correcting some initial typos in the command and file path, I successfully redirected the output of `/challenge/run` to a file located at `/tmp/data.txt`.
2.  Knowing the flag would be in the standard `pwn.college{...}` format, I used the `grep` command to search the output file for that pattern.
3.  The command `grep pwn.college /tmp/data.txt` filtered the contents of the file and printed only the line that contained the flag.

```bash
hacker@piping~grepping-stored-results:~$ /cahllenge/run > /temp/data.txt
bash: /temp/data.txt: No such file or directory
hacker@piping~grepping-stored-results:~$ /cahllenge/run > /tmp/data.txt
bash: /cahllenge/run: No such file or directory
hacker@piping~grepping-stored-results:~$ /challenge/run > /tmp/data.txt
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : /tmp/data.txt
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /challenge/.data.txt

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /challenge/.data.txt file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called /tmp/data.txt. Checking...

[HINT] File descriptors are inherited from the parent, unless the FD_CLOEXEC is set by the parent on the file descriptor.
[HINT] For security reasons, some programs, such as python, do this by default in certain cases. Be careful if you are
[HINT] creating and trying to pass in FDs in python.

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
hacker@piping~grepping-stored-results:~$ grep pwn.college /temp/data.txt
grep: /temp/data.txt: No such file or directory
hacker@piping~grepping-stored-results:~$ grep pwn.college /tmp/data.txt
pwn.college{QwrgqITIIBQEPEAjs7m5ocv-u5d.QX4EDO0wSO0AzNzEzW}

## What I learned

**`grep`** (Global Regular Expression Print) is an essential command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression or a simple string. It's incredibly useful for filtering large amounts of output to find specific pieces of information, like a flag. ðŸ“œ

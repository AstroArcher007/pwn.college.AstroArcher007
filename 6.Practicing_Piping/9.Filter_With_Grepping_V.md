# Filtering with grep -v

The challenge was to filter out decoy lines from an output stream to reveal the true flag.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{oGts-gc7FnvAtzZQDbR85R4nL1u.0FOxEzNxwSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I piped the standard output of the `/challenge/run` program directly into the `grep` command.
2.  I used the **`-v`** command-line option, which instructs `grep` to **invert its match**.
3.  By running `grep -v DECOY`, I filtered out all lines containing the word "DECOY", which removed all the noise from the output and left only the flag.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@piping~filtering-with-grep-v:~$ /challenge/run | grep -v DECOY
pwn.college{oGts-gc7FnvAtzZQDbR85R4nL1u.0FOxEzNxwSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

The **`-v`** (or `--invert-match`) option for `grep` is an extremely useful tool for filtering. Instead of showing lines that *match* a pattern, it shows only the lines that **do not match**. This is perfect for removing known-bad entries, log spam, or any other "noise" to help you focus on the important data. ðŸš«

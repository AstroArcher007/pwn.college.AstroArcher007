# Writing to Multiple Programs

The challenge was to take the output from one program and send it simultaneously as input to two other programs.

1.  My first few attempts to use multiple pipes or redirection operators failed, as a single stream cannot be split into multiple program inputs that way.
2.  The successful solution involved combining the **`tee`** command with **process substitution**.
3.  The final command was `/challenge/hack | tee >(/challenge/the) >(/challenge/planet)`.
4.  Here's how it works: the output of `/challenge/hack` is piped to `tee`. `tee` then writes its input to the "files" provided as arguments. By using process substitution, `>(/challenge/the)` and `>(/challenge/planet)`, we create file-like inputs for the two target programs.
5.  This effectively duplicated the output stream from `/challenge/hack` and fed it into both `/challenge/the` and `/challenge/planet` simultaneously, solving the challenge.

Are you sure you're properly redirecting input into '/challenge/the'?
Are you sure you're properly redirecting input into '/challenge/planet'?
hacker@piping~writing-to-multiple-programs:~$ /challenge/hack | >(/challenge/the) >(/challenge/planet)
bash: /dev/fd/63: Permission denied
Are you sure you're properly redirecting input into '/challenge/planet'?
Are you sure you're properly redirecting input into '/challenge/the'?
hacker@piping~writing-to-multiple-programs:~$ /challenge/hack | tee >(/challenge/the) >(/challenge/planet)
This secret data must directly and simultaneously make it to /challenge/the and 
/challenge/planet. Don't try to copy-paste it; it changes too fast.

## What I learned

This challenge demonstrates a powerful combination of shell features. While **`tee`** can duplicate a stream to files, combining it with **process substitution (`>(...)`)** elevates its utility. This combination allows you to treat the standard input of other programs as if they were files, enabling a single output stream to be piped as input to multiple commands simultaneously.

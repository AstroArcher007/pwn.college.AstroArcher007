# Appending Output

This challenge was designed to teach the difference between overwriting and appending output to a file.

-----

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{kM0MoVInI60Q0jCxERetKbuGq1e.QX3ATO0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I ran the `/challenge/run` executable.
2.  Crucially, I used the **append operator `>>`** to redirect the program's standard output to the file `/home/hacker/the-flag`.
3.  The program first wrote the first half of the flag directly to the file. Then, it wrote the second half to standard output. Because I used append mode, the second half was added to the end of the file instead of overwriting it.
4.  I then used `cat the-flag` to read the file, which now contained the complete, correctly assembled flag.

```bash
hacker@piping~appending-output:~$ /challenge/run >> /home/hacker/the-flag
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : /home/hacker/the-flag

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] Good luck!

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called /home/hacker/the-flag. Checking...

[HINT] File descriptors are inherited from the parent, unless the FD_CLOEXEC is set by the parent on the file descriptor.
[HINT] For security reasons, some programs, such as python, do this by default in certain cases. Be careful if you are
[HINT] creating and trying to pass in FDs in python.

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
I will write the flag in two parts to the file /home/hacker/the-flag! I'll do 
the first write directly to the file, and the second write, I'll do to stdout 
(if it's pointing at the file). If you redirect the output in append mode, the 
second write will append to (rather than overwrite) the first write, and you'll 
get the whole flag!
hacker@piping~appending-output:~$ cat the-flag

\|/ This is the first half:
 v 
pwn.college{kM0MoVInI60Q0jCxERetKbuGq1e.QX3ATO0wSO0AzNzEzW}
                              ^
     that is the second half /|\
                              |

If you only see the second half above, you redirected in *truncate* mode (>) 
rather than *append* mode (>>), and so the write of the second half to stdout 
overwrote the initial write of the first half directly to the file. Try append 
mode!

## What I learned

There are two primary ways to redirect standard output to a file, and they have a critical difference:

  * **`>` (Truncate/Overwrite):** This operator will **overwrite** the contents of the destination file. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.
  * **`>>` (Append):** This operator will **add** the output to the **end of the file**, preserving any existing content. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created.

# Redirecting Errors

The challenge was to redirect two different output streams, standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr), to separate files.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Yheb26OQz1K36XxaXp-4-zKeZ_U.QX3YTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I ran the `/challenge/run` program.
2.  I used `> myflag` to redirect the standard output stream (where the flag would be printed) to the `myflag` file.
3.  Simultaneously, I used `2> instructions` to redirect the standard error stream (containing informational text) to the `instructions` file.
4.  This successfully separated the two streams as the challenge required.
5.  Finally, I used `cat myflag` to read the flag from the standard output file.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-errors:~$ /challenge/run >myflag 2>instructions
hacker@piping~redirecting-errors:~$ cat instructions
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : myflag
[INFO] - the challenge will check that error output is redirected to a specific file path : instructions
[INFO] - the challenge will output a reward file if all the tests pass : /flag

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /flag file.

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called myflag. Checking...

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!

[TEST] You should have redirected my stderr to instructions. Checking...

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stderr looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
hacker@piping~redirecting-errors:~$ cat myflag

[FLAG] Here is your flag:

## What I learned

Shells manage program inputs and outputs using **file descriptors**, which are represented by numbers. The three most common are:

  * `0`: **Standard Input** (stdin)
  * `1`: **Standard Output** (stdout)
  * `2`: **Standard Error** (stderr)

The redirection operator `>` is actually a shortcut for `1>`. To redirect a different stream, you must specify its number. Therefore, **`2>` is used to specifically redirect the standard error stream**.

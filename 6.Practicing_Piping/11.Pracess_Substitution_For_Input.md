# Process Substitution for Input

This challenge required using process substitution to provide the output of two different programs as file-like inputs to the `diff` command.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{skpM10Ecqd18xhGCi0ckX7AQzOu.0lNwMDOxwSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I used the **`diff`** command, which is designed to find differences between two files.
2.  For both inputs to `diff`, I used **process substitution** with the syntax `<(...)`.
3.  The first input, `<(/challenge/print_decoys)`, ran the program that prints only decoy text. The second, `<(/challenge/print_decoys_and_flag)`, ran the program that prints the same decoys plus the flag.
4.  The shell presented the output of each command to `diff` as if they were temporary files. `diff` then compared them and printed only the line that was unique to the second program's output, which was the flag.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@piping~process-substitution-for-input:~$ diff <(/challenge/print_decoys) <(/challenge/print_decoys_and_flag)
48a49
> pwn.college{skpM10Ecqd18xhGCi0ckX7AQzOu.0lNwMDOxwSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

**Process substitution** (`<(/path/to/program)`) is a powerful shell feature that allows the output of a command to be treated as a temporary file. This is extremely useful for commands that expect file paths as arguments, like `diff` or `cat`. It lets you directly compare or process the output of commands without needing to manually save the output to temporary files first.

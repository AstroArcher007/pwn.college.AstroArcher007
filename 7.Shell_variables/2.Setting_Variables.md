# Setting Variables

The challenge was to define a shell variable and assign it a specific value.

-----

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{ACwvEuD38t5emsj7f2OsMOn1RMb.QX5UTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I set the shell variable named **`PWN`** to the string value **`COLLEGE`**.
2.  The correct syntax for this is `VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE`, with no spaces around the equals sign.
3.  Executing the command `PWN=COLLEGE` successfully set the variable, which the challenge environment detected, and the flag was awarded.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{ACwvEuD38t5emsj7f2OsMOn1RMb.QX5UTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

To **set a shell variable**, you use the syntax `NAME=value`. It is a common mistake, but critical to remember, that there can be **no spaces** on either side of the equals sign. This is different from many other programming languages.

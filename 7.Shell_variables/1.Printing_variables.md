# Printing Variables

The challenge was to print the value of a stored environment variable.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Ic83IJhHf0jjuhZDeHIYPFLGZg6.QX3UTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I used the **`echo`** command to print text to the console.
2.  To access the value of the `FLAG` variable, I prefixed its name with a dollar sign (`$`), as in **`$FLAG`**.
3.  The shell substituted the variable with its stored value, and `echo` printed the resulting string, which was the flag.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{Ic83IJhHf0jjuhZDeHIYPFLGZg6.QX3UTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

**Shell variables** are named placeholders that store data. To access the value stored in a variable (a process called "expansion"), you must prefix the variable's name with a **`$`**. The `echo` command is a simple and effective way to display these values.

# Reading Input

The challenge was to read a line of user-provided text from standard input and store it in a shell variable.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{cWgMlI1IaO-G2qyxvWk3DLflAQP.QX4cTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I ran the command **`read PWN`**. This command pauses the script and waits for the user to provide a line of input.
2.  At the prompt, I typed the required string, **`COLLEGE`**, and pressed Enter.
3.  The `read` command captured my input and assigned it as the value to the `PWN` variable, which satisfied the challenge condition and revealed the flag.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read PWN
COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is your flag:
pwn.college{cWgMlI1IaO-G2qyxvWk3DLflAQP.QX4cTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

The **`read`** command is a shell builtin that reads a single line from standard input (or from a file descriptor) and assigns it to one or more variables. It's the primary way to gather input from a user in an interactive shell script, allowing you to prompt for information and store the response for later use.

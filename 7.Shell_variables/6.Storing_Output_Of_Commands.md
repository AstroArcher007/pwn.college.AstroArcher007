# Storing Command Output

The challenge was to capture the output of a command and store it in a shell variable.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{MKxbvxpLlirNH06pBLB9byIQ3U3.QX1cDN1wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I used **command substitution** to execute the `/challenge/run` program and capture its output.
2.  The command `PWN=$(/challenge/run)` ran the program, and the `$(...)` syntax caused the shell to take the program's standard output and assign it as the value for the `PWN` variable.
3.  With the flag now stored in the variable, I used `echo $PWN` to print its contents to the terminal.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@variables~storing-command-output:~$ PWN=$(/challenge/run)
Congratulations! You have read the flag into the PWN variable. Now print it out 
and submit it!
hacker@variables~storing-command-output:~$ echo $PWN
pwn.college{MKxbvxpLlirNH06pBLB9byIQ3U3.QX1cDN1wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

**Command substitution** is a shell feature that allows you to use the output of a command as part of another command. The syntax **`$(command)`** tells the shell to execute the `command` inside the parentheses and replace the entire `$(...)` expression with the command's standard output. This is a core technique for writing scripts and chaining tools together in powerful ways.

# Reading Files

The challenge was to combine the `read` command with input redirection to read the contents of a file into a variable.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{kBN-nU0u-yCJkX_rOcMzCX6DeyJ.QXwIDO0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  I used the **`read PWN`** command, which reads a line of input and stores it in the `PWN` variable.
2.  To provide the input from a file instead of the keyboard, I used the **input redirection operator (`<`)**.
3.  The full command, `read PWN < /challenge/read_me`, connected the standard input of the `read` command to the `/challenge/read_me` file. This caused the first line of the file to be read into the `PWN` variable, solving the challenge.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN </challenge/read_me
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{kBN-nU0u-yCJkX_rOcMzCX6DeyJ.QXwIDO0wSO0AzNzEzW}
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ 
```

## What I learned

This challenge demonstrates how standard shell tools can be combined. The **`read`** command isn't just for interactive user input. Since it operates on standard input, you can use the **input redirection operator (`<`)** to make it read from any file. This is a common pattern for processing files line-by-line in shell scripts.

# Multi-word Variables

The challenge was to assign a value containing a space to a single shell variable.

## My Solve

**Flag:** `pwn.college{Q57-xOuNR9yR22inKcNY3MMBQUt.QXwYTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}`

1.  To assign a string with multiple words, like "COLLEGE YEAH", to a variable, the string must be enclosed in **quotes**.
2.  I used the command `PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"` to accomplish this.
3.  The double quotes ensured that the shell treated "COLLEGE YEAH" as a single value to be assigned to the `PWN` variable, which solved the challenge.

<!-- end list -->

```bash
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{Q57-xOuNR9yR22inKcNY3MMBQUt.QXwYTN0wSO0AzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned

When working with shell variables, if the value you want to assign contains **spaces or other special shell characters**, you must enclose it in quotes (either single `'...'` or double `"..."`). This prevents the shell from splitting the value into separate words or misinterpreting the characters, ensuring the entire string is assigned correctly.
